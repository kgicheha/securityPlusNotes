Hardware 
The physical components of a computer.

Operating System (OS)
The interface between computer hardware and the user
Responsible for making the computer run as efficiently as possible and easy to use. 
They help humans and computers communicate with each other	
The OS does this by taking care of all the messy details related to controlling, the computer's hardware, so you don't have to.
Computers communicate in a language called binary, which consists of 0s and 1s. 
The OS provides an interface to bridge this communication gap between the user and the computer, allowing you to interact with the computer in complex ways.

For example, as a security analyst, you may be responsible for configuring and maintaining the security of a system by managing access.
You may also be responsible for managing and configuring firewalls, setting security policies, enabling virus protection, and performing auditing, accounting, and logging to detect unusual behavior

The OS handles resource and memory management to ensure the limited capacity of the computer system is used where it's needed most. 
For example, if a computer is running slowly, an analyst might discover it's allocating resources to malware.

Types of Operating Systems:
Windows
macOS
Linux
ChromeOS
Android
 iOS

Legacy operating system
An operating system that is outdated but still being used. 
Some organizations continue using legacy operating systems because the software they rely on is incompatible with newer operating systems.
Legacy operating systems can be vulnerable to security issues because they’re no longer supported or updated. This means that legacy operating systems might be vulnerable to new threats. 


Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) 
A microchip that contains loading instructions for the computer and is prevalent in older systems
BIOS
Booting the computer means that a special microchip called a BIOS is activated
On many computers built after 2007, the chip was replaced by the UEFI. 
Often, the BIOS is not scanned by the antivirus software, so it can be vulnerable to malware infection.

Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)
A microchip that contains loading instructions for the computer and replaces BIOS on more modern systems.

Both BIOS and UEFI contain booting instructions that are responsible for loading a special program called the bootloader

Bootloader 
Responsible for starting the operating system.

An application
A program that performs a specific task
The application sends your request to the operating system. 
From there, the operating system interprets this request and directs it to the appropriate component of the computer's hardware.

Completing a task


Virtual machine (VM)
A virtual version of a physical computer. Virtual machines are one example of virtualization. 
Virtual machines can be managed with a software called a hypervisor.

Hypervisors 
Help users manage multiple virtual machines and connect the virtual and physical hardware. 
Hypervisors also help with allocating the shared resources of the physical host machine to one or more virtual machines.

Virtualization 
Process of using software to create virtual representations of various physical machines. 
Virtual systems don’t use dedicated physical hardware. 
Instead, they use software-defined versions of the physical hardware. 
This means that a single virtual machine has a virtual CPU, virtual storage, and other virtual hardware. 
Virtual systems are just code.


The benefits of virtual machines
Provides an isolated environment, or a sandbox, on the physical host machine.
Although using virtual machines is useful when investigating potentially infected machines or running malware in a constrained environment, there are still some risks. 
For example, a malicious program can escape virtualization and access the host machine. This is why you should never completely trust virtualized systems.

an efficient and convenient way to perform security tasks. 
You can open multiple virtual machines at once and switch easily between them. This allows you to streamline security tasks, such as testing and exploring various applications.
Random Access Memory (RAM) 
A hardware component used for short-term memory.
