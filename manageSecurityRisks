Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks

Security Posture
An Organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data, and react to change

CISSP SECURITY DOMAINS

Security and Risk Management
Focused on:
Defining security goals and objectives → Organizations can reduce risks to critical assets and data like PII
Risk mitigation: having the right procedures and rules in place to quickly reduce the impact of a risk like a breach
Compliance → the primary method used to develop an organization's internal security policies, regulatory requirements, and independent standards
Business Continuity Plans → an organization's ability to maintain their everyday productivity by establishing risk disaster recovery plans.
Legal Regulations → following rules and expectations for ethical behavior to minimize negligence, abuse, or fraud.
Professional and organizational ethics

Asset Security 
Focused on securing digital and physical assets. 
It’s also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data.
 
Security Architecture and Engineering
Focused on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place to protect an organization’s assets and data
Shared responsibility → all individuals within an organization take an active role in lowering risk and maintaining both physical and virtual security. 
Other design principles include: threat modeling, least privilege, defense in depth, fail securely,  separation of duties, keep it simple, zero trust, and trust but verify

Communication and Network Security
Focused on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications

Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Focused on access and authorization to keep data secure, by making sure users follow established policies to control and manage assets. 
IAM uses what is referred to as the principle of least privilege, which is the concept of granting only the minimal access and authorization required to complete a task
Component of IAM
Identification → when a user verifies who they are by providing a user name, an access card, or biometric data such as a fingerprint.
Authentication → the verification process to prove a person's identity, such as entering a password or PIN
Authorization → takes place after a user's identity has been confirmed and relates to their level of access, which depends on the role in the organization.
Accountability → refers to monitoring and recording user actions, like login attempts, to prove systems and data are used properly.

Security Assessment and Testing
Focused on identifying and mitigating risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. 
Security assessments help organizations determine whether their internal systems are secure or at risk. Organizations might employ penetration testers, often referred to as “pen testers,” to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a threat actor. 
Security control testing can help an organization identify new and better ways to mitigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities. 
This involves examining organizational goals and objectives, and evaluating if the controls being used actually achieve those goals. 
Collecting and analyzing security data regularly also helps prevent threats and risks to the organization.
Analysts might use security control testing evaluations and security assessment reports to improve existing controls or implement new controls. 
An example of implementing a new control could be requiring the use of multi-factor authentication to better protect the organization from potential threats and risks.

Security Operations
Focused on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures. Investigations begin once a security incident has been identified. 
This process requires a heightened sense of urgency in order to minimize potential risks to the organization. 
If there is an active attack, mitigating the attack and preventing it from escalating further is essential for ensuring that private information is protected from threat actors.
Once the threat has been neutralized, the collection of digital and physical evidence to conduct a forensic investigation will begin. 
A digital forensic investigation must take place to identify when, how, and why the breach occurred. This helps security teams determine areas for improvement and preventative measures that can be taken to mitigate future attacks.
Key strategies, processes, and tools for Security Operations:
	Training
	Reporting and documentation
	Intrusion detection and prevention
	SIEM tools
	Log Management
	Incident Management
	Playbooks
	Post-breach forensics
	Reflecting on Lessons Learned
Security Development Security
Focuses on using secure coding practices
Secure coding practices are recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services. 
By ensuring that each phase of the software development lifecycle undergoes security reviews, security can be fully integrated into the software product.
For example, performing a secure design review during the design phase, secure code reviews during the development and testing phases, and penetration testing during the deployment and implementation phase ensures that security is embedded into the software product at every step. This keeps software secure and sensitive data protected and mitigates unnecessary risks to an organization.

Social Engineering
A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or vulnerabilities. 

Threat
Any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets

Risk
The likelihood of a threat occurring
Anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or vulnerability of an asset. 
Risk is categorized into low, medium, or high 

Low-risk Asset
Information that would not harm the organization’s reputation or ongoing operations, and would not cause financial damage if compromised. 
This includes public information such as website content, or published research data.

Medium-risk Asset
Might include information that's not available to the public and may cause some damage to the organization's finances, reputation, or ongoing operations.
For example, the early release of a company's quarterly earnings could impact the value of its stock.

High-risk Asset
Any information protected by regulations or laws, which if compromised, would have a severe negative impact on an organization's finances, ongoing operations, or reputation. 
This could include leaked assets with SPII, PII, or intellectual property.

Vulnerability
A weakness that can be exploited by a threat
Examples of vulnerabilities include an outdated firewall, software, or application; weak passwords; or unprotected confidential data. 
People can also be considered vulnerable. People's actions can significantly affect an organization's internal network. Whether it's a client, external vendor, or employee, maintaining security must be a united effort.

Ransomware
Malicious attacks where threat actors encrypt an organization’s data and demand payment to restore access
Once ransomware is deployed by an attacker, it can:
Freeze network systems
Leave devices unusable
Encrypt, or lock confidential data, making devices inaccessible.







Risk Management Framework (RMF)

Prepare 
Activities that are necessary to manage security and privacy risks before a breach occurs
Use this step to monitor for risks and identify controls that can be used to reduce those risks.

Categorize
Used to develop risk management processes and tasks
Security professionals then use those processes and develop tasks by thinking about how the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and information can be impacted by risk.
Understand how to follow the processes established by your organization to reduce risks to critical assets, such as private customer information.

Select
To choose, customize, and capture documentation of the controls that protect an organization. 
An example of the select step would be keeping a playbook up-to-date or helping to manage other documentation that allows you and your team to address issues more efficiently.

Implement security and privacy plans
Having good plans in place is essential for minimizing the impact of ongoing security risks. 
For example, if you notice a pattern of employees constantly needing password resets, implementing a change to password requirements may help solve this issue.

Access
To determine if established controls are implemented correctly. 
An organization always wants to operate as efficiently as possible. 
So it's essential to take the time to analyze whether the implemented protocols, procedures, and controls that are in place are meeting organizational needs. 
During this step, analysts identify potential weaknesses and determine whether the organization's tools, procedures, controls, and protocols should be changed to better manage potential risks.

Authorize
Being accountable for the security and privacy risks that may exist in an organization. 
As an analyst, the authorization step could involve generating reports, developing plans of action, and establishing project milestones that are aligned with your organization's security goals.

Monitor
To be aware of how systems are operating. 
Assessing and maintaining technical operations are tasks that analysts complete daily. 
Part of maintaining a low level of risk for an organization is knowing how the current systems support the organization's security goals. 
If the systems in place don't meet those goals, changes may be needed.







Common strategies used to manage risks include:

Acceptance: Accepting a risk to avoid disrupting business continuity

Avoidance: Creating a plan to avoid the risk altogether

Transference: Transferring risk to a third party to manage

Mitigation: Lessening the impact of a known risk

Vulnerability 
A weakness that can be exploited by a threat. Therefore, organizations need to regularly inspect for vulnerabilities within their systems. 

Some vulnerabilities include:

ProxyLogon
A pre-authenticated vulnerability that affects the Microsoft Exchange server. 
This means a threat actor can complete a user authentication process to deploy malicious code from a remote location.

ZeroLogon
A vulnerability in Microsoft’s Netlogon authentication protocol. 
An authentication protocol is a way to verify a person's identity. 
Netlogon is a service that ensures a user’s identity before allowing access to a website's location.

Log4Shell
Allows attackers to run Java code on someone else’s computer or leak sensitive information. 
It does this by enabling a remote attacker to take control of devices connected to the internet and run malicious code.

PetitPotam
Affects Windows New Technology Local Area Network (LAN) Manager (NTLM). 
It is a theft technique that allows a LAN-based attacker to initiate an authentication request.

Security logging and monitoring failures
Insufficient logging and monitoring capabilities result in attackers exploiting vulnerabilities without the organization knowing it

Server-side request forgery
Allows attackers to manipulate a server-side application into accessing and updating backend resources. It can also allow threat actors to steal data.


Security Frameworks
Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy. 
Frameworks can be used to create plans that increase employee awareness and educate them about how they can protect the organization, their co-workers, and themselves. 
Educating employees about existing security challenges is essential for minimizing the possibility of a breach.

Security Controls
Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks

Types of Security Controls
Encryption
Process of converting data from a readable format to an encoded format
Typically, encryption involves converting data from plaintext to ciphertext. 
Ciphertext is the raw, encoded message that's unreadable to humans and computers. 
Ciphertext data cannot be read until it's been decrypted into its original plaintext form
Authentication
The process of verifying who someone or something is. 
A real-world example of authentication is logging into a website with your username and password.
Another example: multi-factor authentication
Authorization 
Refers to the concept of granting access to specific resources within a system.
Authorization is used to verify that a person has permission to access a resource.

Cyber Threat Framework (CTF)
Provides “a common language for describing and communicating information about cyber threat activity.
By providing a common language to communicate information about threat activity, the CTF helps cybersecurity professionals analyze and share information more efficiently. 
This allows organizations to improve their response to the constantly evolving cybersecurity landscape and threat actors' many tactics and techniques.

International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27001
A Family of standards enables organizations of all sectors and sizes to manage the security of assets, such as financial information, intellectual property, employee data, and information entrusted to third parties. 
This framework outlines requirements for an information security management system, best practices, and controls that support an organization’s ability to manage risks.

CIA Triad
A foundational security model used to set up security policies and systems. 
Confidentiality → only authorized users can access specific assets or data
Integrity → the data is correct, authentic, and reliable
Availability → data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it. 

National Institute of Standards and Technology Framework (NIST Framework)

NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk
