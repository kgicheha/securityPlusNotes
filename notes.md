NETWORK SECURITY CONCEPTS
Firewall
A network device that controls network traffic based on predetermined rules. Firewalls can also be software-based or hardware-based, depending on your network requirements.
 
Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
A network security system designed to detect malicious activity within a network. IDS systems can be either network-based or host-based and are often used in conjunction with other network security mechanisms such as firewalls.

Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) 
A network security system designed to prevent malicious activity within a network by monitoring network traffic for suspicious patterns and blocking any activities that appear dangerous or potentially malicious. 

Access Control List (ACL) 
A list of rules used to control access to resources on a network, including specific IP addresses, users, and ports. ACLs can be configured for either read or write operations on specific network.

Network Access Control (NAC)
A network security solution that allows administrators to restrict access to a network based on the user’s identity, device type, and other criteria. 

Virtual Private Networks (VPN) 
An encrypted network connection used to securely connect two or more private networks over a public network such as the Internet. 

Cryptography 
The study of how data is protected through encryption algorithms and cryptographic protocols. 

SSL/TLS
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are network protocols used to secure network traffic. 

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) 
A network security solution that uses public-key cryptography to authenticate network users and their devices. 

Network Address Translation (NAT) 
A network security technique that allows private networks to use one or more public IP addresses for outgoing traffic. 

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) 
attacks are malicious attempts to overwhelm network resources with large amounts of network traffic from multiple sources or locations. 

Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) 
An internet standard protocol suite for establishing secure, encrypted connections between network devices. 

Terminal Access Controller Access Control System (TACACS)
A network security protocol used to authenticate network users and their devices. 

Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) 
A network authentication protocol used to securely connect network users with network services such as VPNs, network access control (NAC), and wireless networks. 

Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA/WPA2) 
Most commonly used wireless network security protocol for encrypting traffic between Wi-Fi access points and clients. 

Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) 
A network authentication protocol used to securely authenticate network users. 

Intrusion Prevention System/Intrusion Detection System (IPSO) 
A network security solution that combines network intrusion detection with network intrusion prevention capabilities. 

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) 
A network security solution that consolidates log data from multiple sources into one centralized repository for monitoring, analysis, and reporting. 
These security systems (called SIEMs) combine host-based and network-based intrusion detection systems that combine real-time network traffic monitoring with historical data log file scanning to provide administrators with a comprehensive picture of all activity across the network. SIEMs are similar to intrusion prevention systems (IPS), which scan network traffic for suspicious activity, policy violations, unauthorized access, and other signs of potentially malicious behavior in order to actively block the attempted intrusions. An IPS can also log security events and send notifications to the necessary players in the interest of keeping network administrators informed.

Endpoint Security 
A network security solution designed to protect network devices from malicious activity and threats, including malware and unsecured network connections. 

Unified Threat Management (UTM) 
A network security solution that combines multiple network security solutions, such as firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, antivirus software, and more into one unified platform. 

Access control
This refers to controlling which users have access to the network or especially sensitive sections of the network. Using security policies, you can restrict network access to only recognized users and devices or grant limited access to noncompliant devices or guest users.

Antivirus and anti-malware software
Malware, or “malicious software,” is a common form of cyberattack that comes in many different shapes and sizes. Some variations work quickly to delete files or corrupt data, while others can lie dormant for long periods
