NETWORK SECURITY CONCEPTS
Firewall
A network device that controls network traffic based on predetermined rules. Firewalls can also be software-based or hardware-based, depending on your network requirements.
 
Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
A network security system designed to detect malicious activity within a network. IDS systems can be either network-based or host-based and are often used in conjunction with other network security mechanisms such as firewalls.

Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) 
A network security system designed to prevent malicious activity within a network by monitoring network traffic for suspicious patterns and blocking any activities that appear dangerous or potentially malicious. 

Access Control List (ACL) 
A list of rules used to control access to resources on a network, including specific IP addresses, users, and ports. ACLs can be configured for either read or write operations on specific network.

Network Access Control (NAC)
A network security solution that allows administrators to restrict access to a network based on the userâ€™s identity, device type, and other criteria. 

Virtual Private Networks (VPN) 
An encrypted network connection used to securely connect two or more private networks over a public network such as the Internet. 

Cryptography 
The study of how data is protected through encryption algorithms and cryptographic protocols. 

SSL/TLS
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are network protocols used to secure network traffic. 

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) 
A network security solution that uses public-key cryptography to authenticate network users and their devices. 

Network Address Translation (NAT) 
A network security technique that allows private networks to use one or more public IP addresses for outgoing traffic. 

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) 
attacks are malicious attempts to overwhelm network resources with large amounts of network traffic from multiple sources or locations.
