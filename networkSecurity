Network
A group of connected devices
E.g. laptops, cellphones, printers

Local Area Network(or LAN)
Spans a small area like an office building, a school, or a home. 
For example, when a personal device like your cell phone or tablet connects to the WIFI in your house, they form a LAN. The LAN then connects to the internet.

Wide Area Network( or WAN) 
Spans a large geographical area like a city, state, or country. You can think of the internet as one big WAN. An employee of a company in San Francisco can communicate and share resources with another employee in Dublin, Ireland over the WAN.

Network Security
Important because it ensures that newwork systems are safe and resilient to be able to protect user data against threats and attacks

Network Traffic Analysis
Looking at network across various applications and network layers and seeing what the traffic is doing and find any vulnarabilities and concerns.

Network Devices
Devices that maintain information and services for users of a network. 
These devices connect over wired and wireless connections. 
After establishing a connection to the network, the devices send data packets. The data packets provide information about the source and the destination of the data.

Hub
A network device that broadcasts information to ever device on the network

Switch
A device that makes connections between specific devices on a network by sending and receiving data between them. 
More secure than hubs

Router
A network device that connects multiple networks together

If a computer in one network wants to send information to a tablet on another network, then the information will be transferred as follows: 
The information travels from the computer to the router. 
The router reads the destination address, and forwards the data to the intended network's router.
The receiving router directs that information to the tablet.

Modem
A device that connects your router to the internet and brings internet access to the LAN

If a computer from one network wants to send information to a device on a network in a different geographic location, it would be transferred as follows:
The computer would send information to the router. 
tThe router would then transfer the information through the modem to the internet. 
The intended recipient's modem receives the information, and transfers it to the router. 
Finally, the recipient's router forwards that information to the destination device.

Virtualization tools
Pieces of software that perform network operations. 
Virtualization tools carry out operations that would normally be completed by a hub, switch, router, or modem, and they are offered by Cloud service providers. 
These tools provide opportunities for cost savings and scalability. You'll learn more about them later in the certificate program.

Firewall
A network security device that monitors traffic to or from your network. 
Firewalls can also restrict specific incoming and outgoing network traffic. 
The organization configures the security rules. 
Firewalls often reside between the secured and controlled internal network and the untrusted network resources outside the organization, such as the internet.

Servers 
Provide a service for other devices on the network. The devices that connect to a server are called clients.
The following graphic outlines this model, which is called the client-server model. 
In this model, clients send requests to the server for information and services. 
The server performs the requests for the clients. 
Common examples include DNS servers that perform domain name lookups for internet sites, file servers that store and retrieve files from a database, and corporate mail servers that organize mail for a company. 


Wireless Access Point 
Sends and receives digital signals over radio waves creating a wireless network. Devices with wireless adapters connect to the access point using Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi refers to a set of standards that are used by network devices to communicate wirelessly.




Network Diagrams 
Topographical maps that show the devices on the network and how they connect. 
Allow network administrators and security personnel to imagine the architecture and design of their organization’s private network.

Cloud Computing
The practice of using remote servers, applications, and network services that are hosted on the internet instead of on local physical devices.
Cloud providers offer an alternative to traditional on-premise networks, and allow organizations to have the benefits of the traditional network without storing the devices and managing the network on their own.

Cloud Network 
A collection of servers or computers that stores resources and data in a remote data center that can be accessed via the internet.
 Because companies don't house the servers at their physical location, these servers are referred to as being "in the cloud”

Cloud Service Provider (CSP)
A company that offers cloud computing services. 
These companies own large data centers in locations around the globe that house millions of servers. 

CSPs provide three main categories of services:

Software as a service (SaaS) 
Software suites operated by the CSP that a company can use remotely without hosting the software. 

Infrastructure as a service (Iaas) 
The use of virtual computer components offered by the CSP. These include virtual containers and storage that are configured remotely through the CSP’s API or web console. 
Cloud-compute and storage services can be used to operate existing applications and other technology workloads without significant modifications. 
Existing applications can be modified to take advantage of the availability, performance, and security features that are unique to cloud provider services.

Platform as a service (PaaS) 
Tools that application developers can use to design custom applications for their company. 
Custom applications are designed and accessed in the cloud and used for a company’s specific business needs.

Software-defined networks (SDNs) 
Made up of virtual network devices and services. 
Just like CSPs provide virtual computers, many SDNs also provide virtual switches, routers, firewalls, and more.

Benefits of cloud computing and software-defined networks 
Reliablity
Cost
Scalability 


Data packet
A basic unit of information that travels from one device to another within a network. 
When data is sent from one device to another across a network, it is sent as a packet that contains information about where the packet is going, where it's coming from, and the content of the message.
A data packet is very similar to a physical letter
It contains a header that includes the internet protocol address, the IP address, and the media access control, or MAC, address of the destination device. 
It also includes a protocol number that tells the receiving device what to do with the information in the packet. 
Then there's the body of the packet, which contains the message that needs to be transmitted to the receiving device. 
Finally, at the end of the packet, there's a footer, similar to a signature on a letter, the footer signals to the receiving device that the packet is finished.

The movement of data packets across a network can provide an indication of how well the network is performing. Network performance can be measured by bandwidth.

Bandwidth 
The amount of data a device receives every second. 
You can calculate bandwidth by dividing the quantity of data by the time in seconds. 

Speed 
The rate at which data packets are received or downloaded. 

Security personnel are interested in network bandwidth and speed because if either are irregular, it could be an indication of an attack. 

Packet sniffing
The practice of capturing and inspecting data packets across the network.
