Key Cybersecurity Terms and Concepts

Compliance 
Process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations and enables organization to avoid fines and security breaches

Security Frameworks
Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy

Security Controls
Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks
They are used with security frameworks to establish a strong security posture. 

Security Posture
An organizations ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change
A strong security posture leads to lower risk for the organization. 

Threat Actor (or malicious attacker)
Any perso or group who presents a security risk
The risk can relate to computers, applications, networks, and data

Internal Threat
Can be a current or former employee, an external vendor, or a trusted partners who poses a security risk

Network Security
The practice of keeping an organization’s network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access. 
This includes data, services, systems, and devices that are stored in an organization’s network 

Cloud Security
Process of ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured or set up correctly, and access to those assets is limited to authorized users
The cloud is a network made up of a collection of servers or computers that store resources and data in a remote physical location known as data centers that can be accessed via the internet
Cloud security is a growing subfield of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on the protection of data, applications, and infrastructure in the cloud

Programming
Process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks
These tasks include:
	Automation or repetitive tasks (e.g. searching a list of malicious domains)
	Reviewing web traffic
	Alerting suspicious activity

Security Analyst Transferable Skills
	Communication → document and report any findings
	Collaboration → with stakeholders and other team members
	Analysis
	Problem-solving → proactively identify and solve problems
	Time management → prioritizing tasks appropriately 
	Growth mindset → willingness and motivation to keep learning 
	Intellectual curiosity
	Diverse perspective → having respect for each other

Security Analyst Technical Skills
Programming languages → Python and SQL → Analysts may sometimes work with software development teams to analyze and support security, install software, and set up appropriate processes. When involved with software development projects, it can be helpful for an analyst to understand programming languages.
Security information and event management (SIEM) tools → collect and analyze log data, or record events such as unusual login behavior. When security analysts need to review vulnerabilities, they conduct a periodic security audit. This is a review of an organization’s records, activities, and related documents. During audits, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools help analysts better understand security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.
Computer forensics 
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDs) →monitor system activity and alerts for possible intrusion
Threat landscape knowledge → Being aware of the current trends related to threat actors, malware, or threat methodologies
Incident response → following established policies and procedures to respond to incidents appropriately 

Personally Indefinable Information (PII)
Any information used to infer an individual’s identity
Includes persons’ full name, date of birth, address, phone number, email address, IP address

Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (SPII)
A specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines
May include social security numbers, medical and financial data, and biometric data(e.g. Facial recognition)
Key assets that a threat actor searches for during a breach 




Malware
Software designed to harm devices or networks 

Some of the most common types of malware attacks today include:

Virus
Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software
Attaches itself to a software or document then spreads itself to one or more computers in a network
A virus needs to be initiated by a user (e.g. threat actor), who transmits the virus via a malicious attachment or file download. 
When someone opens the malicious attachment or download, the virus hides itself in other files in the now-infected systems. 
When the infected files are opened, it allows the virus to insert its own code to damage and/or destroy data in the system

Worms
Malware that self-replicates, spreading across the network and infecting computers
In contrast to a virus, a worm does not need to be downloaded by a user
Instead, it self-replicates and spreads from an already infected computer to other devices on the same network

Ransomware
A malicious attack is where threat actors encrypt an organization’s data and demand payment to restore access. 

Spyware
Malware that is used to gather and sell information without consent. 
Spyware can be used to access devices
This allows threat actors to collect personal data, such as private emails, texts, voice and image recordings, and locations 

Password Attack
An attempt to access password-secured devices, systems, networks, or data. 
Types password attacks:
Brute force
Uses trial and error to crack passwords
Rainbow table
Uses a special table to crack the password hashes in a database

Phishing
The use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software

Some of the common types of phishing attacks today:

Business Email Compromise (BEC)
A threat actor sends an email message that seems to be from a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for information, in order to obtain a financial advantage

Spear Phishing
A malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group of users
The email seems to originate from a trusted source

Whaling 
A form of spear phishing
Threat actors target company executives to gain access to sensitive data

Vishing
The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source

Smishing
The use of text messages to trick users, in order to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known user 


Social Engineering
A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables
Human error is usually a result of trusting someone without question
It is the mission of a threat actor, acting as a social engineer, to create an environment of false trust and lies to exploit as many people as possible

Some of the common types of Social Engineering attacks today include:

Social media phishing
A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites. Then, they initiate an attack
Water hole attack
	A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users
USB baiting 
A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network
Physical social engineering
A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location 

Reasons why Social Engineering attacks are efficient include:
Authority
Threat actors impersonate individuals with power. This is because people, in general, have been conditioned to respect and follow authority figures. 
Intimidation
Threat actors use bullying tactics. This includes persuading and intimidating victims into doing what they’re told. 
Consensus/ Social Proof
Because people sometimes do things that they believe many others are doing, threat actors use other’s trust to pretend they are legitimate. 
For example, a threat actor might try to gain access to private data by telling an employee that other people at the company have given them access to that data in the past. 
Scarcity
A tactic used to imply that goods or services are in limited supply. 
Familiarity
Threat actors establish a fake emotional connection with users that can be exploited.  
Trust
Threat actors establish an emotional relationship with users that can be exploited over time. They use this relationship to develop trust and gain personal information.
Urgency
A threat actor persuades others to respond quickly and without questioning.

Physical Attack
Security incident that affects not only digital by also physical environments where the incident is deployed
 
Some forsm of physical attacks:
Malicious USB cable
Malicious flash drive
Card cloning and skimming

Adverserial Artificial Intelligence
A technique that manipulates AI and machine learning technology to conduct attacks more efficiently. 
Falls under both the communication and network security and the identity and access management domains. 

Supply-chain Attack
Targets systems, applications, hardware, and/or software to locate a vulnerability where malware can be deployed. 
Because every items sold undergoes a process that involves third parities, this means that the security breach can occur at any point in the supply chain. 
These attacks are costly because they can affect multiple organization and the individuals who work for them. 
Supply-chain attacks can fall under several domains, including but not limited to the security and risk management, security architecture and engineering, and security operations domains. 

Cryptographic Attack
Affects secure forms of communication between a sender and intended recipient. 
Fall under the communication and network security domain 

Some forms of cryptographic attacks:
Birthday
Collision
Downgrade

The Morris worm helped shape the security industry because it led to the development of computer emergency response teams, now commonly referred to as computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs). 

CISSP SECURITY DOMAINS
Helps an organization and its security team fortify against and prepare for a data breach. 
Data breaches range from simple to complex and fall under one or more domains. 

8 CISSP Security Domains
Security & Risk Management
Defines security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and law
E.g making sure the company has policies in place that follow government rules
Asset Security
Secures digital and physical assets. It’s also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data. 
Security Architecture & Engineering
Optimizes data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place. 
E.g. incomining and outgoing network traffic. 
Communications & Network Security
Manages and secure physical networks and wireless communications. 
E.g. creating network policies
Identity & Access Management
Keeps data source, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets, such as networks and applications. 
E.g. setting up employee keycards
Security Assessment & Testing
Conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. 
E.g. Conducting audits of user permissions to make sure that users have the correct user access and no unauthorized users have access to the certain data
Security Operations
Conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures. 
E.g. if a unathorized device gains access to the companies networks, an analyst will need to follow the polices and procedures to stop the device. 
Software Development Security
Uses secure coding practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services. 
Work with software development teams to ensure that security practices are incorporated into the software development lift cycle
E.g. advices on the password policies or ensure that the user data is properly secured and managed.
